# Backlog

Open bugs, debt, and enhancements. Add new entries with `- [ ]` and enough context to act on later.

- [ ] maybe implement with another model and check results?

- [ ] when done, integrate with the synonims project

- [x] `build/ingest_news.py` — completed 2026-09-08: 479/479 shards,
  2,186,239,880 tokens, 6,636,815 ro docs, 2,943,510 unique words, 27.9h.
  `compute_zipf.py --source news` → floor=0.36. Lesson carried forward for
  `subs`/`eu`: a wedged (not crashed) ingester defeats the restart-loop's
  blind retry-on-nonzero-exit, and this hit two different causes here (a
  stalled fetch, then a huggingface_hub retry-storm background thread) before
  `os._exit()` on the second Ctrl+C proved reliable — reuse that signal
  handler pattern rather than the plain flag-only one if `subs`/`eu` also do
  large blocking remote reads.

- [x] `build/ingest_subs.py` — completed 2026-09-08: 371,104,866 lines,
  1,936,897,280 tokens, 2,165,628 unique words, 75.4 min (slower than the
  ~200k lines/s smoke-test rate suggested — real sustained rate was
  ~82-87k lines/s; the `--test` "in 1s" timing was too coarse to trust for
  extrapolation). `compute_zipf.py --source subs` → floor=0.41.
  `validate.py` 2/2 across all four sources. Top-20 has a strong, genuine
  conversational signature (`nu` #2, colloquial `asta`/`te`/`sunt` present)
  clearly distinct from the three written-register sources.

- [ ] M3 still needs `eu` (Europarl/DGT) before the panel reaches ≥5 sources
  and `merge.py`'s trimmed-mean branch (spec §13 M3 "done when") is
  reachable. Also a direct OPUS download — can likely reuse most of
  `ingest_subs.py`'s download-resume/single-file-processing shape.
